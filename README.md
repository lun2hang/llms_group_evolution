# Group evolution,next generation LLM training paradigm

0 LLMS can mutually compete with and help each other to form a stronger group

1 Multi agents can be SFTed by other agents' positive samples and guided by self experiences with rl. This shows how human evolved

2 Agents can have lifetime,top Agents clone themselves,bottom Agents vanish.

3 All the mechanism realize a ecosystem obeying Theory of Evolution.

4 This training paradigm will work in all multiagents scene,Ads\Recommendation\Unmanned call center\Unmanned Vehicle\Human kind robots\Drones

5 LLMs can be deployed in different data center,which means this fit power/data distribution well and can scale up to the whole world just like what we human being do
